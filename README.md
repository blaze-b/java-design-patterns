## Structural Design Pattern

## Adapter Design Pattern

- Acts as a converter foe old systems
- Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect
- It lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces
- It is also known as the wrapper
- Intention:
  - Match an old component to a new system
  - Wrap an existing class with a new interface
- When to use: create a reusable class that cooperates with classes which don't have compatible interfaces
