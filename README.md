## JAVA Design Patterns

- Code should be written like poetry

- Authors of Design patterns are Gang of Four, Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson 
and John Vlissidies in the year 1994

### Follow Pattern Categories

- Whenever 'new' is called use - Creational

- Use of class hierarchies and relationships - Structural

- Increase the flexibility in carrying out communication - Behavioral

### Better Coding Should bring in easier understandability

### Design first Approach

- Instead of beating around the bush and jumping to coding right away, first analyse the requirements and design the 
solution

- Before even making a single line of code change, understand the design flow, that might take time
initially but would save a lot of time later and avoid run necessary bugs and issues

- Use flow charts, data flow diagrams, time sequence diagrams and all other design tools available to
draw and understand design
  
### Successful Software

- A successful software in one which is secure, usable, performs well and satisfies all user requirements

- This can be achieved with correct design and accurate implementation

### Journey of creating Successful Software

- On the journey of creating successful software several engineers have faced commonly occurring design issues 
related to memory leak, object creation, classes structuring, components communication and wiring.
  
- Documented these problems and solutions for other engineers benefit as design patterns

### Design Pattern

- Design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in a software design.

- It includes some of the best practices adapted by experienced object-oriented software developers.

- It describes the problem, the solution, when to apply the solution, and its consequences

- It is a ready-made templates that can be applied to your own designs to solve common problems which
could be related to object creation, object communication, class structuring or anything else
  
- It gives a leg-up in creating flexible and maintainable object-oriented systems

### Advantages

- Makes your life easier by not reinventing the wheel.

- Use the power of a shared vocabulary

- Solve issues even before they become visible

- Better code quality

- Improve your object-oriented skills

- Recognise the patterns in libraries and languages

- Give you an extra edge for job and promotion
